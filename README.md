# JWT with refresh token

**Yep, I upload the .env 😀 and please don't mind my error handling as it sucks.**

### Frontend with normal live server for html templates

### Backend, just run
```
npm install
```

### Start by running
```
npm start
```

### The user name and password for test is as shown as below ⬇️
```javascript
{
  username: "testuser",
  password: "password"
}
```
### Then, refresh it as the lifetime for access token is only ***500ms***. After that it will update by the aid of refresh token.

### 🤩 Voalah, that's the beauty of it. 🤩
